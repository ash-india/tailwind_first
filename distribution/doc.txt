npx tailwindcss init - A new file tailwind.config.js will get created

inside src directory create input.css file and write  tailwind directives

@tailwind base; 
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

Now for different style a class name is available
with the tags put the classname just like inline css

Now in the terminal run
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./distribution/style.css --watch

This command converts all the class name to their equivalent css blocks 
and got defined in style.css stored in distribution directory

Also declare the html file path in content int tailwind.config.js

for dark theme, dark:bg-red-500 dark:text-white
for hover effect, hover: bg-red-200

Tailwind css is a mobile first approach
for media query there are different sixes available md, sm, 
So the effects or css written are first applied on the smallest widths

So for the smallest screen the effects declared without any media-query statements got into the effect
It goes on till a breakpoint arrives, let the breakpoint be sm(min-width: 640px), then or the screen size, 
sm and larger the effect defined under sm will get into effect, and then if any breakpoint arrives, 
then the required effect will get into action.

If we want to give exact values then we can use variable 
for example if we want to give padding of 2px then p-[2px],
for padding of 14 px in x-axis px-[14px]
